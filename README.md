Bike sharing project
> Outline a brief description of your project.


Table of Contents
* General Info:
This project will show how bike sharing use increases or decreases depending on various factors such as weather, what season it is what time of the day or what month of the year and so on.
* Technologies Used:
The codes in Juypter is obviously written in python.
* Conclusions
After completing the project it was found that 'Temparature', 'Weather' and 'Year' will show the most coeefficient increase or decrease in Bike Sharing.
* Acknowledgements
Referred from the Housing Case Study which was shared.



General Information
- Provide general information about your project here.
This bike sharing project will determine when the sharing will be of most use which will help the investors to spend their money at the right time.
- What is the background of your project?
This project was shared to us on the module as an assignmemnt.

- What is the business probem that your project is trying to solve?
This project will help the investors to invest at the right time to gain profits and also help users/customers with the availability of the bikes and also get the best offers.
- What is the dataset that is being used?
Fanaee-T, Hadi, and Gama, Joao, "Event labeling combining ensemble detectors and background knowledge", Progress in Artificial Intelligence (2013): pp. 1-15, Springer Berlin Heidelberg, doi:10.1007/s13748-013-0040-3.


Conclusions 1
- As per our Final Model, the top 3 predictor that influences the bike booking are:
Temperature (temp) - A coefficient value of ‘0.5636’ means that there is an increase in the bike hire numbers by 0.5636 units.
Weather Situation 3 (weathersit_3) - A coefficient value of ‘-0.3070’, means that there is a decrease in the bike hire numbers by 0.3070 units.
Year (yr) - A coefficient value of ‘0.2308’ which means there is an increase in the bike hire numbers by 0.2308 units.

Conslusion 2
Season_4: The coefficient value of ‘0.128744’ means there is an increase in the bike hire numbers by 0.128744 units.
windspeed: The coefficient value of ‘-0.155191’ means there is an decrease in the bike hire numbers by 0.155191 units



Technologies Used:
- Jupyter 
- library matplotlib.pyplot, numpy, panda and seaborn.
